This post demonstrates the typography and styling available in your posts. The CSS uses semantic variables that you can easily customize in `src/styles/global.css`.

## Headings

Headings are styled with appropriate sizing and weight. Use `##` for major sections and `###` for subsections.

### Subsection Example

Content flows naturally under headings with comfortable line height and spacing.

## Text Formatting

Regular paragraph text is optimized for readability. You can use **bold text** for emphasis, *italic text* for titles or terms, and `inline code` for technical references.

> Blockquotes are styled with a left border accent. Use them for callouts, quotes, or important notes that should stand out from the main content.

## Lists

Unordered lists work great for features or options:

- First item in the list
- Second item with more detail
- Third item to round it out

Ordered lists are perfect for steps or sequences:

1. Install the dependencies
2. Configure your site
3. Start writing posts
4. Build and deploy

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are styled for readability:

```javascript
// Example function
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

const message = greet('World')
console.log(message)
```

The code styling uses your monospace font stack and provides good contrast for scanning code quickly.
