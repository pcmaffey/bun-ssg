Bun SSG uses an islands architecture for client-side interactivity. Most of your site is static HTML, but you can add interactive React components that hydrate on the client.

## The Counter Example

Here's a simple counter component that demonstrates client-side state:

<Counter />

This counter is fully interactive - click the buttons to increment or decrement the value. The component only loads JavaScript for the parts of the page that need it.

## How Islands Work

1. During the build, island components render as placeholder `<div>` elements with a `data-island` attribute
2. The build detects which islands are used on each page
3. Only the necessary JavaScript is bundled and loaded for that page
4. On the client, the islands hydrate and become interactive

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: fast static pages with targeted interactivity where you need it.

## Creating Your Own Island

To create an island:

1. Create a component in `src/components/` with a default export
2. Register it in `src/registry.ts` using `defineIslands`
3. The placeholder is auto-generated and available in MDX

See the Counter component for a complete example of this pattern.
