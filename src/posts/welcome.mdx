This is an example post demonstrating the basic features of Bun SSG. This static site generator is built with [Bun](https://bun.sh) and React, offering fast builds and a great developer experience.

Posts are written in MDX, which allows you to use JSX components directly in your markdown content.

## Getting Started

To create a new post, add an MDX file to the `src/posts` directory:

- Create a standalone file like `my-post.mdx`
- Or create a folder with `my-post/index.mdx` for posts with assets

Each post needs frontmatter with at least a `title`, `slug`, and `publishedAt` date.

## Using Components

You can use any components registered in `src/registry.ts` within your MDX. This includes custom components and interactive islands.
